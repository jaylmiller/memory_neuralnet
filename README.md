Run the main.py script to test the network.

The final project for Neural Network Modeling at JHU, in which we developed a dual route "memory network" using the exemplar based ALCOVE model (1992) as the memory route and a standard feedword net, with no hidden layers and logistic activation functions. W then used this model to attempt to investigate learning of the past tense form of verbs over time in children.
